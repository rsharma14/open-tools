Question:1
A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents. The average volume of data that the company collects from each site daily is 500 GB. Each site has a high-speed Internet connection. The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a single Amazon S3 bucket. The solution must minimize operational complexity. Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket. Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket.
B. Upload the data from each site to an S3 bucket in the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket. Then remove the data from the origin S3 bucket.
C. Schedule AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device jobs daily to transfer data from each site to the closest Region. Use S3 CrossRegion Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket.
D. Upload the data from each site to an Amazon EC2 instance in the closest Region. Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. At regular intervals, take an EBS snapshot and copy it to the Region that contains the destination S3 bucket. Restore the EBS volume in that Region.

Answer: A
Explanation:
S3 Transfer Acceleration uses Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations to accelerate uploads, making it ideal for large, distributed data sources.
Multipart uploads allow efficient, reliable, and parallel uploads of large files.
This approach minimizes operational complexity (no need to manage replication, EC2, or Snowball devices).
The sites have high-speed Internet, so direct upload is feasible and fast.

Question:337
A company has deployed a web application on AWS. The company hosts the backend database on Amazon RDS for MySQL with a primary DB instance and five read replicas to support scaling needs. The read replicas must lag no more than 1 second behind the primary DB instance. The database routinely runs scheduled stored procedures.

A company operates a two-tier application for image processing. The application uses two Availability Zones, each with one public subnet and one private subnet. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) for the web tier uses the public subnets. Amazon EC2 instances for the application tier use the private subnets. Users report that the application is running more slowly than expected. A security audit of the web server log files shows that the application is receiving millions of illegitimate requests from a small number of IP addresses. A solutions architect needs to resolve the immediate performance problem while the company investigates a more permanent solution. What should the solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?

A. Modify the inbound security group for the web tier. Add a deny rule for the IP addresses that are consuming resources.

D. Start with S3 Standard storage (0-30 days). Create an S3 life cycle policy to transition objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3-IA. after 30 days, and then to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. 

Explanation: 
This lifecycle policy matches the known access patterns: S3 Standard (frequent, daily access 0-30 days) → S3-IA (infrequent, quarterly access 30 days-1 year) → S3 Glacier Deep Archive (archival after 1 year). This is more cost-effective than using S3 Intelligent-Tiering for known patterns.

Question:740
Applications in three separate VPCs need to communicate with a latency-sensitive application that runs in a single on-premises data center. Needs to consistently send hundreds of gigabytes of data each day and maximize cost effectiveness. Options:

A. Configure three Site-to-Site VPN connections from the data center to AWS...
B. Launch a third-party virtual Network Appliance in each VPC...
C. Set up three Direct Connect connections from the data center to the Direct Connect Gateway...
D. Establish a single AWS Direct Connect connection from the data center to AWS. Create a Transit Gateway and attach each VPC to the Transit Gateway. Establish connectivity between the Direct Connect connection and the Transit Gateway. 

Explanation: 
Direct Connect provides the high bandwidth and low latency required for consistent, large-volume data transfer to on-premises. Transit Gateway acts as a central hub, efficiently connecting all three VPCs to each other and to the Direct Connect connection using a single, cost-effective setup.

Question:741
A distributed application involves several serverless functions and requires manual approvals as part of the workflow. The solution must be able to combine multiple AWS Lambda functions and orchestrate data and services (Lambda, EC2, containers). Options:

A. Use AWS Step Functions.
B. Use AWS Glue.
C. Use SQS...
D. Use Lambda functions and EventBridge events... 

Explanation: 
AWS Step Functions is the serverless orchestrator that uses state machines to define and manage multi-step workflows, including integrating manual approval steps and coordinating diverse compute services (Lambda, EC2, ECS).

Answer: A

Question:742
Most connections to an RDS for MySQL DB instance come from serverless applications (LambdA.. At times of high demand, users report database connection rejection errors. Options:

A. Use an Amazon RDS Proxy.
B. Use Elasticache.
C. Migrate the DB instance to a different instance class that has higher IO capacity.
D. Configure Multi-AZ. 

Explanation: 
RDS Proxy prevents connection rejection errors by maintaining a pool of established database connections and efficiently multiplexing application connections (like those from LambdA. to reuse them.

Answer: A

Question:743
All instances provisioned through an EC2 Auto Scaling Group must successfully send reports to the auditing system as soon as they are launched and terminated. Options:

A. Use a scheduled AWS Lambda function and run a script remotely...
B. Use EC2 Auto Scaling life cycle hooks to run a custom script to send data to the audit system when instances are launched and terminated.
C. Use an Auto Scaling launch configuration to run a custom script through user data.
D. Run a custom script on the instance operating system... 

Explanation: 
Auto Scaling Life Cycle Hooks are the built-in mechanism designed to pause instance launch or termination to allow custom actions (like running an auditing script) to be executed at both the launch and terminate phases.

Answer: B

Question:744
A real-time multiplayer game uses UDP for communications. Developers want to store non-relational data (gamer scores) in a database solution that will scale without intervention. Options:

A. Use Amazon Route 53 for traffic distribution and Amazon Aurora Serverless for data storage.
B. Use a Network Load Balancer (NLB. for traffic distribution. Use Amazon DynamoDB On-Demand for data storage.
C. Use a Network Load Balancer (NLB. for traffic distribution. Use Amazon Aurora for data storage.
D. Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB. to traffic distribution and Amazon DynamoDB. 

Explanation: 
An NLB is required because it is the only load balancer that supports UDP (Layer 4) traffic. DynamoDB On-Demand is the fully managed, non-relational database that scales automatically and provides the low-latency performance required for real-time game data.

Answer: B
